Minecraft is a sandbox game based around mining and crafting in a huge,
endless world with 90s style graphics. There is survival mode, where you travel through different
biomes, crafting tools to help fight, and exploring the huge world. There is
creative, where you can build beyond your imagination. Well, besides that
256 block height limit. You are invincible, allowing you to do things you
couldn't do in survival.

##Single Player Mode

In Single Player Mode, you play alone as you can either be in Survival
or Creative. But, don't worry, if you make your server a LAN party (Local Area
Network) anyone near you can join your world! Single Player Mode
unfortunately does not allow people from all over the globe to come, but
that means you can do whatever you like without other people bothering you.

##Multi Player Mode

Now here is where Minecraft can get very fun. Multiplayer worlds, or,
servers, allow anyone from around the globe to join that server. And, there
are many different types of "servers" but, I won't list them all. Many
famous Minecraft youtubers (e. SkyDoesMinecraft, ExplodingTNT) have their
own server. It's a way of connecting out to the real world, right at home!


In conclusion, if you don't have Minecraft I recommend you try playing the
demo on [minecraft.net](http://www.minecraft.net), or even buying the game
yourself. The game is a great experience, and will not be forgotten.
